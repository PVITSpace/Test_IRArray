  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun! https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14769

  This example reads the MLX90640 and outputs 768 temperature values as fast as possible. 
  Use this example in conjunction with our Processing visualizer.

  We use the Teensy 3.5 for this example. The MLX90640 requires some
  hefty calculations and larger arrays. You will need a microcontroller with 20,000
  bytes or more of RAM.

  This relies on the driver written by Melexis and can be found at:
  https://github.com/melexis/mlx90640-library

  Hardware Connections:
  Connect the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  to the Qwiic board
  Connect the male pins to the Teensy. The pinouts can be found here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/pinout.html
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
